1.) Given a 3SAT problem with 3 binary variables  
(x1, x2, and x3), what is the min number of clauses 
that you would need to create an unsatisfiable sentence?
 
 8

2.) Create a 3SAT sentence with 3 binary variable that is 
not satisfiable using the minimum number of clauses identified 
in part 1.

  (!x1 ∨ !x2 ∨ !x3) ∧(x1 ∨ !x2 ∨ !x3)
∧ (!x1 ∨ !x2 ∨ x3) ∧ (!x1 ∨ x2 ∨ !x3) 
∧ (!x1 ∨ x2 ∨ x3) ∧  (x1 ∨ !x2 ∨ x3)
∧ (x1 ∨ x2 ∨ !x3) ∧  (x1 ∨ x2 ∨ x3)
